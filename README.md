This is just a README to show users what to do when picking this repository. 

Since it is a stub, you will have to solve conflicts by yourself. Be sure to look at files and commits to properly integrate this for your device. The prerequisite files are taken from google's latest 4.14 floral sources for DRM and KingKernel's 3.18 sources for mdss.

All Kcal commits from tbalden are included within this repository, so you know what to pick.
